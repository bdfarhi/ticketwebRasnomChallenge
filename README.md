# ticketwebRasnomChallenge
This is the completed code for the Ransom Note challenge and the Bonus challenge.
The solutions to run both the code and tests is RansomValidator.java , and I’ve included comments at the top of the file on how to run the program.
Additionally, I’ve submitted a brief write-up outlining how I approached the problem and the steps I followed to arrive at my solution.
